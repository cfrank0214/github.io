        <p>I co-founded a technology start-up based on my research in Geographic Information Systems after graduate school, enabling me to gain extensive experience designing and marketing cutting-edge web and mobile applications in markets such as petroleum and real estate. This experience has helped me to understand the nuances in creating applications that can tell a compelling story. The key to a successful high functioning team is communication, both within the team and with organizational stakeholders and I thrive on cross-functional team collaboration to create vision and execute product roadmaps.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Colchester and now live in South Hero, and I am excited by the opportunities your organization has to offer. I'm confident that I'll be able to quickly get the knowledge necessary to leverage my experience and address your unique business challenges. I look forward to discussing your requirements and my ability to add value your team. </p>
